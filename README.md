# Traffic Accident in the US
### An analysis of traffic data, and building an ML model to predict the severity of traffic incidents

Abstract

Since Covid-19, people have started working remotely across several industries and thus, broken the norm that only people working in the technology field can do so. However, now that things are getter better as more and more people are getting vaccinated, employees are slowly being asked to return to the office. Although there is a fair share of people who would enjoy moving back to their office, some people still feel reluctant and want to continue working remotely. One of the factors causing this reluctance is long commute times, which is often exacerbated by traffic accidents. 

This paper delves into questions pertaining to traffic accidents, like what times and days of the week are worse than others, is there any weather or feature that can predict the severity of accidents, and what traffic measures are associated with less severe accidents.
